# Johnson's Dictionary Transcription Helper

This project is a tool to help transcribe entries in Samuel Johnson's classic 1755 dictionary into a computer readable form.

Astonishingly, there is currently no digital edition of this dictionary. Brandi Besalke has set up a project to create one at http://johnsonsdictionaryonline.com/ and has asked for help transcribing the entries..

I signed up, but being the geek that I am, somewhere around the third entry that I transcribed, I began writing a program to do the repetitive bits for me. And here it is, in the hope that it will help other transcribers.
